    "text": "A few weeks ago I ran a poll on Twitter to understand why Angular account has 280k followers on Twitter while Angular-In-Depth has only a fraction of that on Medium (11k). The poll showed that 50% of those who responded don’t use Medium, 17% find stories too complicated, 27% have no time to read and there are people (7%) who find stories not interesting."
